# User API Refactoring Test

## Description

We would like you to refactor the User API. 

Don't worry about breaking changes.

Think about clean code and architecture.

## Limitations

Do NOT change the fact that DatabaseContext uses InMemory database.

Note: A user is REQUIRED to have a first name, last name and age.
